Bounties are a vital tool we have in the Bitcoin ecosystem to drive development forward and provide strong financial incentives, and I'm grateful that the Bitcoin community is rallying behind Silent Payments with bounties.

This page will track all known Silent Payment-related bounties, their amount, and basic info on completion requirements.

## Software wallet implementation bounties

{{% details title="Implement sending to Silent Payment addresses in Samourai - **0.01 BTC**" closed="true" %}}

### Completion requirements

### Some notes

Given the recent events, some people may have concerns about this bounty. We believe in the principles that Samourai stands for: that privacy is not something to be frowned upon, that is it legitimate and necessary, and that we should fight to protect it. We hope this bounty reflects that spirit, and that we should carry on with that fight, in spite of personal antagonisms or regulatory threats.
