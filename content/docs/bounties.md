### Some notes

Given the recent events, some people may have concerns about this bounty. We believe in the principles that Samourai stands for: that privacy is not something to be frowned upon, that is it legitimate and necessary, and that we should fight to protect it. We hope this bounty reflects that spirit, and that we should carry on with that fight, in spite of personal antagonisms or regulatory threats.
